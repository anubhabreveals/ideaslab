				<h3 id="content" style="color:#660000">Requirements Engineering and Design for Variety</h3>
				<p style="color:black">According to a study, over 40% of all defects in a product are due to either
					requirements not appropriately identified or utilized during design. Identification of appropriate
					requirements early in the product development process and their appropriate utilization during the
					process are essential for developing high quality products. The focus of work has been to understand
					the process and mechanisms of <b>requirement identification and satisfaction</b>, and their impact
					on the quality of products and process.</p>
				<p style="color:#333"><b>Design for variety</b> refers to commonalising various aspects of a product
					portfolio in order to optimize costs of a product while offering equivalent variety to the customer
					segments. The focus of research has been to provide commonalisation of materials and processes
					across a product portfolio.</p>

				<h3 id="content" style="color:#660000">Design Synthesis and Creativity</h3>
				<p style="color:black"><b>Engineering design synthesis</b> is considered as a fundamental subset of the
					process of engineering design that helps in the transformation of function into alternative,
					creative structures that can satisfy the function. Many researchers consider engineering design
					synthesis as a central area of design research. Earlier work in this area can be categorised under
					one or more of the following questions:</p>
				<p style="color:#333">What is engineering design synthesis?</br></br>Several researchers have defined
					engineering design synthesis. The definitions are often overlapping and comprise: synthesis as
					designing, synthesis as problem solving, synthesis as design solution generation, synthesis as
					design problem and solution generation and synthesis as exploration, which together comprise the
					processes of task formulation, design representation, composition, design generation, design
					interpretation and re-interpretation, design evaluation, search and optimization. </p>
				<p style="color:#333">How is engineering design synthesis currently done carried out?</br></br>This
					involves understanding several theories, models and approaches proposed earlier for engineering
					design synthesis. This understanding serves as the basis for the improvement of engineering design
					synthesis.</p>
				<p style="color:#333"> How to support design synthesis?</br></br>Based on an understanding of how
					engineering design synthesis is performed, guidelines, methods, tools, etc. are developed and
					evaluated to better support engineering design synthesis.</p>
				<p style="color:black"><b>Design Creativity</b> is the ability to identify, visualize and interpret a
					problem in unusual and interesting ways and to synthesise and develop novel and interesting ideas
					and solutions. Our research led to the development of: (1) a common definition of creativity that
					provided an overarching view of what were reflected variously in the myriad definitions by earlier
					authors, (2) a set of empirically validated measures for the two crucial components of technical
					creativity , novelty and usefulness , and their relationships to creativity, and (3) the major
					factors that influence design creativity. A major observational study undertaken discovered that
					only four fundamental search processes occurred in engineering design, irrespective of what design
					problems are solved, by whom, and whether individually or in teams.</p>
				<h3 id="content" style="color:#660000">Eco-Design and Sustainability</h3>
				<p style="color:black"><b>Eco-Design</b> is an approach to designing systems with an intent of reducing
					its impact on the environment. It is often used synonymously with green design, design for
					environment. One of the guiding principles of Eco-Design is to consider environmental impacts in the
					entire lifecycle: from raw material extraction to after-usage through production, distribution and
					usage. Our research involves understanding designers requirements and developing frameworks, methods
					and tools to assist them in designing systems with environmentally friendly lifecycles.</p>
				<p style="color:#333"><b>Sustainability</b> is the ability to meet our needs and aspirations without
					compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs and aspirations. The term
					sustainability is generally referred in the context of development i.e. in Sustainable Development.
					To develop sustainably is to continue improvement in harmony with the environment, society and
					economy.</p>

				<h3 id="content" style="color:#660000">Design Collaboration and Knowledge Management</h3>
				<p style="color:black"><b>Knowledge Management</b> is about people, using technology to enable more
					efficient processes so that they are better able to capture, store, retrieve, use, reuse and share
					both explicit and tacit knowledge for the financial and business interest of the company (Hylton,
					2002). When it concerns product development, knowledge management addresses the needs of product
					development teams to capture, store, and effectively utilize knowledge in the organization. The
					research questions of interest include: what types of knowledge are generated in an organization?
					How much of these are captured and reused? What knowledge is not captured that should have been
					otherwise?</p>
				<p style="color:#333">The current design scenario of ever increasing customer requirements and
					continuous reduction in products life, forces companies to develop more complex and innovative
					products with high quality and low cost concurrently, in order to meet the above challenges with an
					ever decreasing time to market. <b>Collaborative design</b> is an area that has high potential
					impact in enabling companies achieve this. Companies should utilize all competence available, work
					in teams and scout for talent across the globe to face these challenges. Collaborative design is a
					process in which products are designed through collective effort of many designers. Distributed
					collaborative design is a process in which products are designed through collaboration among design
					teams that often work in parallel, using various engineering tools distributed in separate
					locations, across various time zones around the world. A large number of factors influence the
					collaborative design. Currently the relationships among these factors are not well-understood. The
					current research interests include: understanding and structuring interactions among designers
					during co-located and distributed design collaborations, and the knowledge processes that occur
					during these interactions.</p>
				<h3 id="content" style="color:#660000">Product Aesthetics and Design for Emotions</h3>
				<p style="color:black">Better looking products attract more customer attention. As technology in
					products saturates, the appeal of the product to the customer becomes the key differentiator; this
					is known to strongly influence purchase decisions. Also, in an increasingly competitive market
					wherein producers vie for limited consumer attention, the <b>look and feel</b> of products virtually
					drive the bottom-line of some sectors. Given that purchase decisions cumulatively make or break
					companies, research in this area assumes great importance. We are interested in questions such as:
					What constitutes aesthetic appeal of a product? How to make products aesthetically appealing?</p>
				<p style="color:#333"><b>Emotions</b> enliven us every day and hour. Products we interact with seem to
					gather more importance as they enhance our capabilities. In such a context it becomes important to
					know in what way products are used as intended by designers. Across varied sectors of product
					manufacturers this requirement is varied, though fundamentally it is the emotion that the products
					evoke in us that strike connections engaging us in intended or un-intended way. How to make products
					convey or evoke particular emotions? Answers to such questions are necessary for designers of all
					kinds of products. This is our primary research interest.</p>
				<h3 id="content" style="color:#660000">Design Pedagogy</h3>
				<p style="color:black"><b>Design pedagogy</b> is the area of inquiry into processes and tools for design
					learning and education. Work carried out in IdeasLab in this area include development of new
					teaching methods and curricula in the areas of design methodology, design creativity, and design
					research methodology.</p>
				<h3 id="content" style="color:#660000">Design Research Methodology</h3>
				<p style="color:black">A research discipline is as good as its <b>research methodology</b>. The
					relatively new and interdisciplinary discipline of design research requires a robust, well-tested
					research methodology for supporting the quality of research output and its acceptance in the
					industry and society. Design Research Methodology: I developed DRM (jointly with Ken Wallace in
					Cambridge and Lucienne Blessing in Luxembourg) - arguably the most widely used design research
					methodology in the world. DRM has been taught in several national and international courses for the
					last ten years in Europe and India, training over four hundred PhD students in using DRM for their
					research. DRM has also been published in a Springer book in July 2009, co-authored by the Lucienne
					Blessing and myself, and already sold over three hundred copies. Current research constitutes
					further development of detailed aspects of the methodology in collaboration with Lucienne Blessing.

									generate novel solutions for product design problems by providing, as stimuli,
									information about natural or artificial systems that are analogically relevant for
									solving the problem. It uses the corpus of the diverse motions that nature exhibits
									as a potent source of inspiration for solving product design problems, especially in
									inspiring creativity and innovation of novel products. The software has a database
									with entries from natural and artificial systems, annotated in a unique behavioral
									language, so that automated analogical search can be carried out to retrieve entries
									that have strong likelihood of inspiring novel solutions to a given design problem.
									The designer can browse through the database or incase he has a specific design
									problem to be solved, he can as well use the various search strategies to find
									suitable entries.

								<font color="white">IDEA-SUSTAIN is a computer aid based on a patented impact estimation
									and rational capture technology to help designers develop environmentally friendly
									product lifecycles by supporting synthesis in product development on a commercial
									CAD workspace, while also aiding automated capture of the rationale behind the
									decisions for retrieval during design, and supporting environmental impact analysis
									of product proposals created by automatically extracting information already stored
									while designing and asking for other information required to model the lifecycle,
									with minimal extra effort from the designer. It uses a novel method for uncertainty
									reasoning to estimate the level of confidence on the impact value owing to the
									incompleteness in information available. The estimation is possible at component,
									assembly or product levels, for a single lifecycle phase or for multiple phases. It
									also helps in comparing different lifecycle proposals under uncertainty. Empirical
									studies demonstrated significant reduction in impacts on the environment for product
									life cycles designed using IDEA-SUSTAIN compared to those designed using existing
									commercial tools.
